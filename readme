The lib/ folder contains the actual code (Foo and Bar classes), and spec/ contains the tests using RSpec.RetryDhow to run on localThat's exactly what I showed you - those steps ARE for running it locally on your computer. Let me break it down more clearly:
How to Run on Your Local Machine:
Prerequisites:

Install Ruby on your computer first

Windows: Download from https://rubyinstaller.org/
Mac: Ruby comes pre-installed, or use brew install ruby
Linux: sudo apt-get install ruby-full (Ubuntu/Debian)


Verify Ruby is installed

bashruby --version
Run the Project Locally:

Download the project to your computer

bashgit clone https://github.com/sirmike/sample-ruby-project.git
cd sample-ruby-project

Install Bundler

bashgem install bundler

Install project dependencies

bashbundle install

Run the application

bashruby main.rb
That's it! The application will run on your local machine. The output will appear in your terminal/command prompt.
